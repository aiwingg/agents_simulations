# AutoGen Conversational Engine Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for creating a new conversational engine based on Microsoft AutoGen's Swarm pattern. This engine will replace the existing ConversationEngine while maintaining the same contract interface and leveraging AutoGen's built-in multi-agent coordination, tool calling, and memory management capabilities.

## 🚀 Implementation Status

**Completed Components:**
- ✅ **AutogenModelClientFactory** - Infrastructure layer for centralized OpenAI client creation with Braintrust wrapping
- ✅ **AutogenMASFactory** - Infrastructure layer for creating configured AutoGen Swarm teams (no client creation)
- ✅ **ConversationAdapter** - Service layer for translating AutoGen formats to existing contracts  
- ✅ **AutogenToolFactory** - Session-isolated tool creation for multi-agent environments
- ✅ **AutogenConversationEngine** - Main service implementing ConversationEngine contract using AutoGen Swarm
- ✅ **Comprehensive Test Suites** - All components tested with real AutoGen classes (17 tests passing)
- ✅ **External User Architecture** - User simulation agent operates outside the MAS for proper conversation flow
- ✅ **Conversation Loop Implementation** - Agent → User → Agent pattern with proper message handling
- ✅ **Clean Architecture Refactoring** - Eliminated code duplication and achieved proper layer separation
- ✅ **Prompt Formatting System** - Immutable prompt specification formatting with Jinja2 variable substitution

**Implementation Complete! ✅**
All core components have been successfully implemented and tested with the correct external user architecture and prompt formatting system.

## Architecture Analysis & Challenges

### Original Proposal vs. Final Architecture

**Initial Concerns Addressed:**
1. **Testing Complexity**: AutoGen's components are already testable. Focus shifted to testing conversation logic rather than agent creation.
2. **Abstraction Overhead**: Avoided unnecessary complexity by leveraging AutoGen's native capabilities.
3. **UserProxy Simulation**: Used AutoGen's Swarm handoff mechanism with configurable user target for client simulation.

**Final Architecture Decision:**
Instead of a 2-layer approach, we adopted a **3-component architecture** that maintains separation of concerns while leveraging AutoGen's Swarm pattern.

**🔄 Critical Architecture Revision:**
After implementation, we discovered that the user should NOT be part of the MAS. The correct pattern is:
- **User is external** to the Multi-Agent System
- **Conversation Loop**: Agent responds → User simulation agent responds → repeat
- **MAS termination**: Only uses TextMessageTermination (no HandoffTermination to user)
- **Conversation flow**: Agent → User → Agent pattern, following the interactive_demo.py example

## Component Architecture

### 0. Prompt Formatting System ✅ COMPLETED

**Purpose**: Immutable prompt specification formatting with Jinja2 variable substitution

**Key Components:**
- `AgentPromptSpecification.format_with_variables()` - Creates new instance with formatted prompt
- `SystemPromptSpecification.format_with_variables()` - Formats all agent prompts and validates client agent exists
- Enhanced `_enrich_variables_with_client_data()` - Centralized variable enrichment with defaults and session_id

**Architecture:**
```python
# Immutable formatting pattern
formatted_spec = original_spec.format_with_variables(enriched_variables)

# All agent prompts are formatted
for agent_name, agent_spec in formatted_spec.agents.items():
    # agent_spec.prompt contains formatted text with variables substituted
    pass

# User agent uses formatted client prompt
client_agent = formatted_spec.get_agent_prompt("client")
user_agent = AssistantAgent(name="user_agent", system_message=client_agent.prompt)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Strict variable validation**: Fails fast if required variables are missing from templates
- **Immutable approach**: Creates new instances, original specifications unchanged
- **Centralized enrichment**: All variable processing (webhook data, defaults, session_id) in one place
- **Client agent validation**: Ensures 'client' agent exists for user simulation
- **Jinja2 integration**: Full template support with StrictUndefined error handling

### 1. AutogenModelClientFactory (Infrastructure Layer) ✅ COMPLETED

**Purpose**: Centralized factory for creating OpenAI completion clients with Braintrust wrapping

**Contract:**
```python
class AutogenModelClientFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_from_openai_wrapper(openai_wrapper: OpenAIWrapper) -> OpenAIChatCompletionClient:
        """Creates OpenAIChatCompletionClient from existing OpenAIWrapper config with Braintrust wrapping"""
        # Extract model, api_key from openai_wrapper
        # Create OpenAIChatCompletionClient and wrap with Braintrust for tracing
        # Return wrapped client
```

**Key Features:**
- Single entry point for all OpenAI client creation across the system
- Eliminates code duplication between engine and MAS factory
- Automatically applies Braintrust wrapping for observability
- Clean separation of infrastructure concerns

### 2. AutogenMASFactory (Infrastructure Layer) ✅ COMPLETED

**Purpose**: Lightweight factory for creating configured AutoGen Swarm teams (client-agnostic)

**Contract:**
```python
class AutogenMASFactory:
    def __init__(self, session_id: str):
        self.session_id = session_id
    
    def create_swarm_team(self, system_prompt_spec: SystemPromptSpecification, 
                         tools: List[BaseTool], model_client, 
                         user_handoff_target: str = "client") -> Swarm:
        """Creates Autogen Swarm team from formatted SystemPromptSpecification and pre-created tools"""
        
    def _create_swarm_agents(self, agents_config: Dict[str, AgentPromptSpecification], 
                           tools: List[BaseTool], model_client,
                           user_handoff_target: str) -> List[AssistantAgent]:
        """Creates AssistantAgent instances with handoffs, tools, and user handoffs"""
        
    def _setup_agent_handoffs(self, agents_config: Dict[str, AgentPromptSpecification],
                             user_handoff_target: str) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
        """Configures handoff relationships: agent-to-agent ONLY (user is external)"""
        # Each agent gets: handoffs=["other_agent1", "other_agent2"] - NO user handoff target
        
    def _create_termination_conditions(self, user_handoff_target: str) -> TextMessageTermination:
        """Creates TextMessageTermination only since user is external to MAS"""
```

**Key Features:**
- **NO client creation** - receives pre-created model client from service layer
- **NO tool creation** - receives pre-created tools from service layer  
- Creates AssistantAgent instances with agent-to-agent handoff configuration ONLY
- ⚠️ **REVISED**: User handoff target is ignored - user is external to MAS
- Sets up TextMessageTermination only (no HandoffTermination to user)
- Pure infrastructure layer - no service logic

### 3. AutogenConversationEngine (Service Layer) ✅ COMPLETED

**Purpose**: Main engine implementing the ConversationEngine contract using AutoGen Swarm

**Implementation Details:**

11. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for API blocks, comprehensive error context logging

**Contract Compliance:**
- ✅ Identical input/output contracts to existing ConversationEngine
- ✅ Same error handling patterns (geographic restrictions → `failed_api_blocked`)  
- ✅ Maintains conversation_history structure with tool_calls/tool_results
- ✅ Preserves webhook integration and session management
- ✅ Compatible with existing logging and tracing infrastructure

### 4. ConversationAdapter (Service Layer) ✅ COMPLETED

**Purpose**: Translator between AutoGen's conversation format and existing contract

**Contract:**
```python
class ConversationAdapter:
    @staticmethod
    def autogen_to_contract_format(task_result: TaskResult, session_id: str, 
                                  scenario_name: str, duration: float) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Converts Autogen TaskResult to ConversationEngine contract format"""
        
    @staticmethod
    def extract_conversation_history(messages: List[BaseChatMessage]) -> List[Dict]:
        """Converts Autogen messages to conversation_history format with tool_calls/tool_results"""
```

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Transform AutoGen TaskResult to match existing ConversationEngine output contract
- Convert AutoGen message format to conversation_history structure
- Preserve tool_calls and tool_results structure from existing contract

## AutoGen Swarm Pattern Integration

### Key Swarm Features Leveraged:

1. **Agent Handoffs**: `handoffs=["agent1", "agent2"]` for natural delegation (NO user handoffs)
2. **Natural Flow**: Agents decide when to handoff based on context and completion
3. **⚠️ REVISED User Integration**: User is EXTERNAL - no HandoffTermination to user
4. **Tool Integration**: Each agent gets specific tools via `tools=[tool1, tool2]`
5. **Memory Management**: AutoGen handles conversation context automatically

### Handoff Configuration:

```python
# Example agent configuration - REVISED: NO user handoffs
sales_agent = AssistantAgent(
    "sales_agent",
    model_client=model_client,
    handoffs=["support_agent", "manager_agent"],  # Agent-to-agent only
    tools=[product_search_tool, add_to_cart_tool],
    system_message="You are a sales agent..."
)
```

### Termination Conditions:

```python
# REVISED: Only TextMentionTermination, no HandoffTermination to user
termination = TextMentionTermination("TERMINATE")
```

### Conversation Loop Architecture:

```python
# NEW: External user simulation pattern
while not timeout_reached and turn_count < max_turns:
    # 1. Run MAS until termination (TextMentionTermination only)
    result = swarm.run(task=HandoffMessage(...))
    
    # 2. Extract last agent response
    last_message = result.messages[-1]
    
    # 3. User simulation agent responds (external to MAS)  
    user_response = user_agent.on_messages([last_message], None)
    
    # 4. Loop continues with user response as new task
    turn_count += 1
```

## Module Interactions

### Service Layer Flow:
1. **AutogenConversationEngine** receives scenario with variables
2. **Engine** determines session_id from webhook or generates new one
3. **Engine** enriches variables with webhook data and applies defaults via `_enrich_variables_with_client_data()`
4. **Engine** loads **SystemPromptSpecification** from prompt_spec_name
5. **Engine** formats specification with enriched variables via `format_with_variables()` (immutable)
6. **Engine** creates **OpenAIChatCompletionClient** via **AutogenModelClientFactory**
7. **Engine** creates session-isolated **AutogenToolFactory** 
8. **Engine** creates tools via tool factory for each agent
9. **Engine** calls **AutogenMASFactory** with formatted spec, tools, pre-created client, and user target
10. **Factory** instantiates **Swarm** with configured agents and termination (no client/tool creation)
11. **Engine** creates user simulation agent using formatted client agent prompt
12. **Engine** runs conversation loop with external user simulation agent via repeated `swarm.run()` calls
13. **ConversationAdapter** transforms AutoGen result to contract format
14. **Engine** returns formatted result matching existing ConversationEngine

### Layer Separation:
- **Service Layer**: Business logic, tool creation, conversation orchestration, client creation coordination
- **Infrastructure Layer**: AutoGen team setup, agent configuration (no client or tool creation)
- **Adapter Layer**: Format translation between AutoGen and existing contracts
- **Model Client Layer**: Centralized OpenAI client creation with observability wrapping

## Implementation Benefits

### Advantages of AutoGen Swarm:
- **Built-in Memory**: No need to implement conversation context management
- **Native Handoffs**: Sophisticated agent coordination without custom orchestration
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless tool calling with proper session isolation
- **Error Handling**: AutoGen handles LLM API errors and retries
- **Observability**: Built-in tracing and logging capabilities

### Contract Compatibility:
- Maintains exact same input/output contracts as existing ConversationEngine
- Preserves conversation_history structure with tool_calls/tool_results
- Supports both basic and tool-enabled conversation modes
- Compatible with existing BatchProcessor integration

## Configuration Examples

### SystemPromptSpecification for Swarm:
```json
{
  "name": "sales_support_team",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Multi-agent sales and support team",
  "agents": {
    "sales_agent": {
      "name": "sales_agent", 
      "prompt": "You are a sales agent specializing in product recommendations...",
      "tools": ["rag_find_products", "add_to_cart"],
      "description": "Handles product search and sales",
      "handoffs": {
        "support_agent": "For technical support issues",
        "manager_agent": "For escalations"
      }
    },
    "support_agent": {
      "name": "support_agent",
      "prompt": "You are a technical support agent...", 
      "tools": ["get_cart", "change_delivery_date"],
      "description": "Handles technical support and order modifications",
      "handoffs": {
        "sales_agent": "For new purchases",
        "manager_agent": "For complex issues"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### AutoGen Error Management:
- **API Rate Limits**: AutoGen handles with exponential backoff
- **Tool Failures**: Graceful degradation with error context
- **Agent Handoff Loops**: Termination conditions prevent infinite loops
- **Session Isolation**: Tools maintain separate state per session_id

### Contract Compliance:
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Return `status: 'failed_api_blocked'` 
- **Timeout Handling**: Respect max_turns and timeout_sec parameters
- **Tool Result Parsing**: Maintain existing `_safe_parse_tool_result()` logic
- **Speaker Naming**: Map AutoGen agents to contract speaker format
